Welcome to Beyond Excel Biology, where we explore the intersection of biological research and modern data analysis tools.

<!--more-->

As a biologist, I've often found myself wrestling with Excel spreadsheets, trying to coax meaningful insights from complex datasets. While Excel has its place, the world of biological research demands more sophisticated approaches to data analysis and visualization.

This blog will explore:

- **Modern data analysis tools** for biological research
- **Reproducible research practices** using code and version control
- **Data visualization techniques** that go beyond pie charts
- **Statistical methods** appropriate for biological datasets
- **Integration of bioinformatics** into traditional wet lab workflows

Whether you're a graduate student struggling with your first RNA-seq dataset or a seasoned researcher looking to modernize your analysis pipeline, you'll find something here.

Let's move beyond Excel and embrace the powerful tools that can transform how we understand biological data.
