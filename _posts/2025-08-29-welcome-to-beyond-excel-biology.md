**ðŸš§ This is a placeholder post for site development purposes.**

Welcome to Beyond Excel Biology - a work-in-progress blog exploring the intersection of biological research and modern data analysis tools.

## About This Site

This is currently a development version with placeholder content while I build out the site structure and begin writing actual posts.

## Planned Topics

Once live, this blog will explore:

- **Modern data analysis tools** for biological research
- **Reproducible research practices** using code and version control  
- **Data visualization techniques** that go beyond spreadsheets
- **Statistical methods** appropriate for biological datasets
- **Integration of computational tools** into research workflows

## Coming Soon

Real content is coming soon! This placeholder will be replaced with actual insights, tutorials, and discussions about moving biological research beyond traditional spreadsheet limitations.

*Stay tuned for updates as the site develops.*
