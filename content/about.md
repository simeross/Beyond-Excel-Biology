## About Beyond Excel Biology

Welcome to Beyond Excel Biology! I'm a plant pathologist and bioinformatician passionate about making research more reproducible, efficient, and accessible through better tools and practices.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog documents useful tools, concepts, and workflows that can help researchers of any technical background improve their work. Topics include:

- **Plain text and automation** - Moving beyond proprietary formats for more portable, automatable workflows
- **AI integration** - Practical applications of large language models in research
- **Productivity tools** - Software and methods that actually save time and reduce frustration
- **Data analysis** - Approaches that prioritize reproducibility and clarity

## The Philosophy

Too much valuable research time is lost to inefficient tools and practices. Every minute spent wrestling with software, recreating lost work, or trying to reproduce old results is time not spent on actual discovery.

This blog aims to share practical solutions that work in real research environments - not just in theory.

## Technical Details

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on GitHub Pages. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/simeross/Beyond-Excel-Biology). All content is written in Markdown and version-controlled, practicing what I preach about reproducible, portable workflows.
